# CQRSalad
[Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html):
> CQRS stands for Command Query Responsibility Segregation. It's a pattern that I first heard described by [Greg Young](http://codebetter.com/gregyoung/). At its heart is the notion that you can use a different model to update information than the model you use to read information.
